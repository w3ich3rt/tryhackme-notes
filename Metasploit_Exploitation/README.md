To get the smb_login module working, I need to set two parameters for the encryption.

```shell
set SMB::AlwaysEncrypt false
set SMB::ProtocolVersion 1
```

Without this config I got an errormessage.

```text
Exploit failed: RubySMB::Error::EncryptionError Communication error with the remote host: Socket read returned nil. The server supports encryption but was not able to handle the encrypted request.
